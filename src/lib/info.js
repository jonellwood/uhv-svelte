I'm ${firstName}. I am a father, husband, brother, friend, runner, video game player, web developer, and much more. I am also someone who has struggled with weight loss, keeping the weight off, and portion control. I am in my mid 40's with an adult-child (wait that doesn't sound right) and two young children under the age of 7 (as of this writing). As I have aged I have realized that eating bacon, eggs, and cheese every day (low-carb diet) as a way to stay trim(ish) was not a healthy long term plan that ends with me meeting my grandchildren.

As such, my research lead me land upon, not a diet, but more a set of guideline for eating called ${bzlinkText} I am starting the blog around the same time I am changing the way I eat and think about food with the hopes of documenting it - the good and the bad - and making it available to anyone else who might find value in it. 

I am also realizing this might be a but much for a 'bio' module....
