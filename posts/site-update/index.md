# Finally have had a chance to get back to it

I have not had a chance to work on this site for a few weeks now. Life and all that.

But I have been logging my meals, and Apple of course is tracking workouts, weight, etc... so I will be getting more data added to the site. I am in the process of converting everything over from markdown to using Sanity.io as a CDN as well - and it's been a little slow going. Hopefully I will be able to add more dynamic content moving forward as well as show data in a more compelling manner. Right now I am working out the kinks so to speak in getting the data to the CDN and then displaying it in a manner that makes sense.
